# ðŸ’¬ Message from the developer!!

The current version **v2.1.1** of **Atom v2** will be the last version.  
The reason for this is that v2 is the realization of the initial concept of Atom, and there will be several disruptive updates coming in the future to improve convenience.

We will move to **Atom v3** development and implement more convenient APIs. :)

I don't want to process GTFS as it is ðŸ˜Ÿ,  
Try using Atom at such times ðŸ¤—.
